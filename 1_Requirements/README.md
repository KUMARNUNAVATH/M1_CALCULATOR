# CALCULATOR
## Introduction:
   
   Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic four operations in mathematics ,they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division but in this Project which I'm Implementing ,also included five additional operations such as Factorial, Power ,modulas, square, cube .However, the input has to be in the form "number1 operator1 number2 "(i.e 2+4).

The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas/square/cube, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.

The switch-case statement is used to write a simple calculator program in C language. The remainder operator % is normally used with data values. To print the remainder operator %% is used in the first printf() function. The variable ch store the operator, similarly the variables num1, and num2 stores the two numbers. The switch has condition “ch” so the entered operator is matched with which case label those case label statements are executed, and display result to the screen. If the entered operator is not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message “Error! Invalid Operator.” to the screen.
## Swot Analysis
### STRENGTHS
The ultimate strength Calculators is its innovative,user-friendly and long lasting etc..

To help allow students to make quick, accurate mathematical calculations. To help students expand the scope of their mental abilities. To help students better understand intangible concepts, through tangible means. To teach logical thinking, and problem-solving skills.
### WEAKNESSES
do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.
Calculators make teachers lazy and worse teachers than they should be because they don't have to make sure the problem has numbers to assure their students learn the skill intended.
### OPPORTUNITIES
The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other
Printing occupations. Prepress technicians and workers.
### THREATS
The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
